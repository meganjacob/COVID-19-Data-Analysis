# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
Using python and matplotlib I analyzed COVID-19 data and generated a few graphs and a report about cases in Asia. The graphs are saved as png files and the report is displayed by the console once the pogram has run.

The report shows the total number of cases and the graphs look for and compare trends in Asia.

The data used is from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases. The data set used is also in the reposiory.
